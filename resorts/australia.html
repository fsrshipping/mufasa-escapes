					<p class="about__text about__text-right">The Blackwood River is one of the longest permanent rivers in Western Australia. The river was named by Governor James Sterling at its mouth in 1830 after Vice Admiral Sir Henry Blackwood. Stirling was a Midshipman in the Royal Navy, when 1809, he was transferred to the "Warpite" under Captain Henry Blackwood and he received his first commission whilst serving under Blackwood.<br>
                    Sue's Bridge was built in 1966. It is the tallest timber bridge in the south west, at 17.5m. Prior to the bridge being built there was a ford crossing. Sue's Road and Sue's Bridge are named after Suzette Morrison, wife of Forestry Officer Ian Morrison, who was in charge of the roads put in for timber assessment and logging in the 1950's.<br>
                    The towns of the Blackwood River Valley radiate an effortless charm that’s trumpeted in brochures, yet impossible to capture unless you’re actually there. Only a 2.5 hour drive from Perth, the Blackwood is the hidden jewel of the southwest, where winding country roads crisscross undulating green hills, wineries and ancient jarrah forests, with WA’s longest continually running river and only heritage listed town.<br>
                    Between towns, winding country roads crisscross green hills and stands of ancient jarrah forest to sidle up against the beautiful Blackwood River – the ribbon tying the patchwork region together.<br>
                    Changing seasons have a truly beautiful effect here – you can experience enchanting misty mornings in winter, refreshingly cool summer nights, a blaze of colour through the deciduous trees in autumn, and bursts of pinks, purples and yellows in spring. The evenings in the Blackwood River valley can be rather cool, even in the summer, so be sure to pack a jumper or two! Don’t leave town without looking up! The stars, especially the Milky Way, are absolutely amazing.</p>
